## Project Overview

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To compare precipitation patterns between Seattle, WA and New York, NY from 2018 to 2022, and test the common belief that Seattle is the “rainiest” city.
- **Domain:** Climate / Environmental Data Analysis
- **Key Techniques:** Time Series analysis, descriptive statistics, and data visualization.

**Summary:**  
The project uses daily precipitation data from NOAA’s Climate Data Online (CDO) tool. Findings show that while Seattle experiences rain more frequently, New York records higher total rainfall over the same period due to heavier, concentrated rain events. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between rainfall frequency and rainfall volume when evaluating “raininess.”
